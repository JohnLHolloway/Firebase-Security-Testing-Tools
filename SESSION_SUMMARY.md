# Space Invaders ML - Complete Session Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical Training Bug ✅
**Problem**: Model never scored above 10 points
**Root Cause**: `is_game_over()` was matching JavaScript function definitions instead of actual game state
**Solution**: Changed to monitor JavaScript variables (`gameRunning`, `lives`) directly
**Result**: Model now properly trains and scores 60+ points in testing

### 2. Built Complete Distributed Training System ✅
Created a master-worker architecture for parallel training across multiple Raspberry Pis:

**Files Created:**
- `master_server.py` - Orchestrates all training
- `worker_daemon.py` - Runs on each RPi
- `setup_worker.sh` - Automated RPi setup
- `test_worker.py` - Local testing tool

**Features:**
- Auto-discovery of workers on local network
- Job queue management
- Real-time web dashboard
- Parallel hyperparameter search
- Autonomous offline mode (workers continue without master)
- Results saved locally + pushed to Git

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation ✅
- `QUICK_START.md` - 15-minute setup guide
- `DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Full system design
- `RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed RPi setup
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - File organization
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### 4. Cleaned & Organized Codebase ✅
- Removed 11 duplicate/outdated files
- Added proper `.gitignore`
- Organized into logical structure
- Fixed Git commit issues
- Successfully pushed to GitHub

```bash
# Copy files to RPi
scp -r *.py requirements.txt pi@raspberrypi:~/ml-training/

# On RPi:
cd ~/ml-training
pip3 install flask requests stable-baselines3 selenium opencv-python numpy
python3 worker_daemon.py
```

### Monitor Training
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:5000
- **API**: `curl http://localhost:5000/status`
- Workers auto-register and pull jobs

---

## Key Features

### 1. Auto-Discovery
Workers automatically find master on network via UDP broadcast

### 2. Parallel Training
3 RPis = 3 different experiments simultaneously
- Different learning rates
- Different batch sizes
- Different architectures

### 3. Fault Tolerance
- Workers retry on failure
- Master reassigns failed jobs
- Autonomous mode if master offline
- Results saved locally as backup

### 4. Scalability
Add more RPis → automatically discover and utilize

### 5. Real-Time Monitoring
Web dashboard shows:
- Active workers
- Job queue
- Completed jobs with scores
- Best model tracker

---

## Performance

### Training Speed
- Web-based: ~1 FPS
- 100K steps: ~28 hours
- 500K steps: ~5-6 days

### With 3 RPis (Parallel)

- vs 18 days serial

### Target
Beat 25,940 points on jordancota.site leaderboard

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. Flash RPi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS
2. Run setup script
3. Start worker daemon
4. Watch dashboard as training begins

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Let RPis train 24/7
2. Monitor progress daily
3. Collect trained models
4. Evaluate best performers

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Test best model on actual game
2. If score > 25,940: Submit as "John H"
3. If not: Adjust hyperparameters and iterate

### Long-term (Future)
- Add more RPis for faster experimentation
- Implement advanced reward shaping
- Try different network architectures
- Explore ensemble methods

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Emoji encoding errors
**Solution**: Already fixed in master_server.py with UTF-8 handling

### Issue: Alert popups blocking training
**Solution**: Auto-dismiss alerts in `stable_web_env.py`

### Issue: Workers offline when master down
**Solution**: Autonomous mode - workers continue with default config

### Issue: Slow training speed
**Solution**: Distributed system - run multiple experiments in parallel
